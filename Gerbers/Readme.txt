These Gerbers were used to make a set of boards with PCBWAY in April of 2025.  The Board was built and tested.  
comments : 
1, The 0.27uF (270nF) caps were substituted with 0.22uF (220nF) ceramics and the amp circuit works fine.
2, The slide switch on the power line stops the random feedback at power on, I did not have the exact switch so used a substitute.  The M.com file mutes the PSG on boot and if needed with a hanging note etc. 
3, The VU meter bottom 2 LED's stay on at all times and the sensitivity of the VU meter is attenuated too much by the volume POT.  Resistor and/or cap values need fine tuning.
